              <strong>EARLY CIVILIZATIONS:</strong> The Nile Valley and
              Mesopotamia boasted superb cultural achievements and the world's
              first cities by 3000 B.C., at a time when Europeans still lived in
              rude huts. By 1300 B.C., writing preserved legal codes and beliefs
              in one God; calendars captured time. Ambitious Persians extended the
              first modern empire with a common language and coinage, a postal and
              road system, and religious tolerations. Then, in the first major
              invasion from the West, Alexander the Great took the entire Persian
              domain and founded some twenty cities, planting Greek culture. His
              dream of one world &mdash;a unified East and West &mdash;was
              realized by the subsequent <a href="./resources/html/index2.html">Roman Empire.</a> Roads, reservoirs, and
              irrigation works were expanded. Camerl caravans and fleets of
              galleys distributed the papyrus of Egrypt, the incense of southern
              Arabia, the jewels of India, and the silks of China.

              <strong>BYZANTINE AND SASSANID EMPIRES:</strong> As Rome declined,
              its Emperor Constantine turned to the more prosperous Middle East.
              In A.D. 324 he founded his New Rome, later called Constantinople,
              near the Greek colony of Byzantium. Adopting Christianity, he
              married the new religion to Roman law and Greek culture. Government
              regulated all aspects of life, from wages to religious rites; heresy
              was treason. But schisms split off provinces; Egyptian Copts, Syrian
              Maronites, and Nestorians formed their own churches, which still
              survive. border battles broke out between the Byzantines and the
              Persians, whose civilization flowered anew under the Sassanid
              Dynasty. Persians shahs revived ancient Zoroastrianism, with its
              priests, or magi, and its sacred fires. Despite warfare, trade and
              cultural exchanges continued. Byzantine and Oriental artistic
              traditions intermingled.

              <strong>ARAB EMPIRE:</strong> The year one in the Moslem calendar,
              A.D. 622, marked the move of the Prophet Mohammed from Mecca to
              Medina, where he established the rule of Islam. Soon Bedouin
              horsemen exploded out of Arabia, wresting empires from the
              war-weakened Byzantines and Persians. Islam and the Arabic language
              unified and empire that reached its zenith in a single century.
              Mohammed's successors, the Umayyad Dynasty, moved the capital to
              Damascus, adopting Byzantine culture. Grasping power, the rival
              Abbasids emulated the Persians and with Baghdad their capital,
              brought luxuriant court life and learning to new heights. But the
              empire fragmented. Rival dynasties sprang up in Cordoba and Cairo.
              Seljuk Turks usurped power from the Abbasids an then embraced their
              culture. Warfare interfered with Christian pilgrims, helping to
              trigger the Crusades.

              <strong>THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE:</strong>expanded from an Anatolian state
              ruled by the Turkish Ottoman clan to a world power that reached to
              the gates of Vienna. In 1453 Moslem Turks stormed 1,100-year-old
              Christian Constantinople. Establishing a sumptuous court there,
              autocratic sultans imposed an administration so effective that it
              won praise from Martin Luther: "the Turk...rules quite civilly, he
              preserves peace and punishes criminals." Christian slaves
              &mdash;converted to islam, educated, and advanced by merit
              &mdash;rose to govern the realm. Bureaucrats recorded revenue fom
              tribute, imports, religious minorities, and imperial estates. North
              African pirates raided European shipping. Gradually, palace
              intrigues, corruption, and national revolts sapped the empire.
              Safavid Persians successfully resisted Ottoman conquest. Aided by
              Europe, Greeks broke away in 1821, followed by other Balkan peoples.

              <strong>EUROPEAN IMPERIALISM:</strong>Western nations, vaulting
              ahead in technology and military power, extended their rivalries
              into the Middle East. Napoleon's bold invasion of Egypt in 1798 set
              off a race for influence. Britain soon controlled ports on the
              sea-lane to India. France took most of North Africa and brought in
              European settlers. Russia annexed the Caucasus and Turkistan.
              Germany courted the Ottomans, who became her allies in World War I.
              Britain, in turn, supported the Arab revolt against ottoman rule, a
              cause championed by the flamboyant Lawrence of Arabia. Britain and
              France agreed secretly to the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire,
              "the sick man of Europe," and received Arab lands they coveted as
              League of Nations mandates. The Arabs &mdash;schooled in Western
              ideals of nationalism &mdash;rebelled periodically until the
              Europeans withdrew after World War I.
